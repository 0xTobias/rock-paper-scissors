A rock papper scissors project build using scaffold-eth with the chainlink VRF oracle.

https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth

Calling shoot places your bet and calls the chainlink oracle if the amount of participants is fullfilled (In my deploy I set it to 1 as it's for learning porpuses.).

Try it out @ http://rock-paper-scissors.0xtobias.surge.sh/ on rinkeby.
